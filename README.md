## Overview

This repository contains Paula Riquelme's English-only professional portfolio. It presents her work across customer discovery, product strategy, UX/UI, go-to-market execution, and frontend implementation through selected projects, measurable outcomes, professional experience, recognition, and press evidence.

The experience is designed as a product launch dossier, not a generic personal profile. Visitors can understand Paula's range quickly, inspect factual Woku and Inpla case studies, download the English resume, and start a conversation from a fast, accessible static site. Dedicated About, Contact, and Privacy pages provide stable trust anchors for people and agents.

## Product principles

- **Evidence before biography:** selected work and verified outcomes lead the story.
- **One source of truth:** portfolio facts live in [`src/content/portfolio.ts`](src/content/portfolio.ts) and are protected by tests.
- **Static by default:** meaningful content, project evidence, and case studies render to HTML at build time, while JavaScript is reserved for navigation and purposeful motion.
- **Honest project access:** every project card links to a factual case study and the external product website without presenting a screenshot as a live preview.
- **Accessible interaction:** semantic landmarks, keyboard navigation, focus restoration, reduced-motion support, visible focus states, and 44 px touch targets are part of the implementation contract.

## Architecture

Dependencies move in one direction so content, interaction, and presentation remain easy to reason about.

## Run locally

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22
- npm

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PauRiquelmee/pauriquelmee.github.io.git
cd pauriquelmee.github.io
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

To test the same static output deployed to GitHub Pages:

```bash
npm run preview:pages
```

The production build is emitted to `out` and includes `.nojekyll`.

## Quality bar

The repository treats quality requirements as executable constraints:

- Component coverage must remain at or above 90% for statements, lines, and functions, and 85% for branches.
- Lighthouse must reach at least 95 for performance, accessibility, and best practices, plus 100 for SEO.
- Every reusable component has one implementation, one colocated behavior test, and one default folder export.
- Every production TSX file contains one named React component. JSX in callbacks and conditions remains idiomatic and is not counted as a second component.
- JavaScript and TypeScript use arrow functions, single-quoted strings, and double-quoted JSX attributes.
- The production routes, metadata, assets, resume, case studies, navigation, focus behavior, reflow, and reduced-motion path are covered by automated checks.

Run the complete pre-pull-request suite with:

```bash
npm run validate:architecture
npm run validate:agent-docs
npm run format:check
npm run test
npm run coverage
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm run test:e2e
npm run lighthouse
```

## Content and design integrity

- [`PRODUCT.md`](PRODUCT.md) defines the audience, purpose, positioning, constraints, and evidence on hand.
- [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md) documents the product launch dossier direction, visual tokens, responsive rules, and component behavior.
- [`src/content/portfolio.ts`](src/content/portfolio.ts) is the canonical source for every visible professional claim.
- [`assets/source`](assets/source) contains supplied source imagery; [`public`](public) contains browser-ready assets and the English resume.
- [`public/llms.txt`](public/llms.txt) provides when-to-use, source, and accuracy guidance for agents.
- [`public/index.md`](public/index.md) provides the canonical portfolio in Markdown.
- [`public/404.md`](public/404.md) gives agents and people a concise recovery index from the custom 404 page.

All visible copy, metadata, tests, documentation, workflow text, identifiers, and release communication are English only. Factual outcomes, dates, organizations, recognition, and links must remain traceable to the canonical product record.

## Deployment

Pull requests to `main` and pushes to `main` run one complete `Quality gate` job. That job validates architecture and agent documentation, checks formatting, lint and types, enforces coverage, builds the static export once, runs Playwright, and enforces Lighthouse targets. The Pages deploy job depends on that exact job, receives minimum Pages permissions, uploads the already validated `out` artifact, and uses the protected `github-pages` environment.

## Contributing

This is a personal portfolio with a deliberately strict contribution contract. Work happens on `feature/*` or `hotfix/*` branches, follows test-driven development for behavior, preserves the architecture boundaries, and reaches `main` through a reviewed pull request.

Start with [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) before making changes.

## Usage

This repository is public for portfolio review and implementation transparency. It is not published as a reusable template, and no open-source license is currently provided.
